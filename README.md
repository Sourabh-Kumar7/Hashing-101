# Hashing-101

This repository provides an overview of different hashing techniques used in various applications. Hashing is a fundamental concept in computer science, cryptography, and data processing. Here, we'll explore some of the most common hashing algorithms and their key details.

## Hashing Techniques

### 1. SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3)

- Description: SHA-3 is one of the most secure hashing algorithms available and is resistant to various types of attacks. It's suitable for cryptographic purposes.
- Usage: Cryptography, data integrity verification.

### 2. Argon2

- Description: Argon2 is designed for password hashing and is highly secure. It's resistant to GPU and ASIC attacks, making it ideal for secure password storage.
- Usage: Secure password hashing.

### 3. bcrypt

- Description: bcrypt is a secure password-hashing algorithm that incorporates a "work factor" to slow down brute-force attacks. It's widely used for password security.
- Usage: Secure password hashing.

### 4. scrypt

- Description: scrypt is similar to bcrypt and is designed for secure password hashing. It's resistant to brute-force attacks, making it suitable for safeguarding user credentials.
- Usage: Secure password hashing.

### 5. Blake2

- Description: Blake2 is a high-speed cryptographic hash function known for its security and efficiency. It's suitable for various applications.
- Usage: Cryptography, checksums, data integrity verification.

### 6. SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit)

- Description: SHA-256 is a widely used hashing algorithm that provides a high level of security. It's suitable for general cryptographic purposes.
- Usage: Cryptography, data integrity verification.

### 7. Whirlpool

- Description: Whirlpool is a cryptographic hash function known for its strong security profile. It provides a high level of security for various applications.
- Usage: Cryptography, data integrity verification.

### 8. SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)

- Description: SHA-1 is deprecated for most cryptographic uses due to vulnerabilities, but it still has some security for non-cryptographic applications.
- Usage: Legacy non-cryptographic applications.

### 9. MD5 (Message Digest 5)

- Description: MD5 is widely considered insecure for cryptographic purposes due to vulnerabilities and collisions.
- Usage: Legacy non-cryptographic applications.

### 10. CRC32 (Cyclic Redundancy Check)

- Description: CRC32 is not designed for cryptographic security and should only be used for error-checking in data storage and transmission.
- Usage: Data integrity verification in non-cryptographic applications.
